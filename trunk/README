Uni is a lazy programming language with dynamic structure,
grammar and syntax.  Uni is a free software, free as in
freedom. It does not depend on any proprietary libraries
or file formats.

Unlike mainstream programming languages whose grammar
and syntax are fixed and designed by the creator of the
language, Uni gives its users the freedom to modify or
invent the grammar, the syntax, and even the bahavior
of the scanner (a.k.a. the lexer).  For instance, a C++
programmer may prefer the "for each" expression other
languages take for granted, or a mathematician may need a
easier way to write matrix or equation in code, or even
a non-English speaking programmer may want a program
language in his or her mother tongue.  These are very
hard, if not impossible, to have in mainstream programming
languages in use today.  But the Uni programming, with
its extra dimension of freedom for users, allow users to
trim, redefine, or even invent the structure, grammar,
and syntax of the language to fit their own purpose.
Therefore, in a sense, Uni is a meta-language, since
programmers are allowed not only to work on the language
level, but also the level above it.

Uni is designed as a small, minimal library that depends on
virtually nothing but the C++ runtime library and provide
nothing but the absolute basic.  Such a design allows Uni
to be embedded with ease.

The use of Uni can be wide: configuration script for
applications, dynamic contend for websites, programming
for special users (e.g. mathematicians, scientists),
and many more to think about.
