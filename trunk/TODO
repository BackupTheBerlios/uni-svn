* (2005-04-20) now, scanner scan the whole file all at once,
  before anything can be executed. as a result,
  code that change the behavior of the scanner
  will HAVE NO EFFECT when execute a file. this
  makes "str_ctor" USELESS.
  
  maybe add a new class [Special] to hold special names
  that can be only resolved later.

  or instead of inserting symbols, the
  [scanner] can insert application on [name_get]

* (2005-05-06) instead of classifying operators as
  prefix, postfix, and infix, operators should be
  considered as "absorbers", and each can "absorbe"
  a certain number of lexicons on either or both side.
  for example, operator [+] will be an absorber of (1,1)
  [!] will be an absorber of (1,0).

* (2005-05-06) scanners should be in cascade structure.
  one scanner can pass stuff to another scanner.
  this would allow things like markup language easier
  to implement.

* (2005-06-17) a context object should have a set of
  "well known" resources, like stdout, stdin, stderr,
  and etc. so that functions like [raw_out] can behave
  correctly.

* (2005-06-17) some arguments should be passed to scanners
  so that scanners can be more flexible. e.g. change the
  comment splitters, and quotation marks.

* (2005-08-09) what is now [context] should become [machine]
  which take care of the stack machine. what is now [ScopeStack]
  should become [context] which is only the "context".
