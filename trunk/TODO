* (2005-05-06) instead of classifying operators as
  prefix, postfix, and infix, operators should be
  considered as "absorbers", and each can "absorbe"
  a certain number of lexicons on either or both side.
  for example, operator [+] will be an absorber of (1,1)
  [!] will be an absorber of (1,0).

* (2005-05-06) scanners should be in cascade structure.
  one scanner can pass stuff to another scanner.
  this would allow things like markup language easier
  to implement.

* (2005-06-17) a context object should have a set of
  "well known" resources, like stdout, stdin, stderr,
  and etc. so that functions like [raw_out] can behave
  correctly.

* (2005-06-17) some arguments should be passed to scanners
  so that scanners can be more flexible. e.g. change the
  comment splitters, and quotation marks.

* (2005-08-09) what is now [context] should become [machine]
  which take care of the stack machine. what is now [ScopeStack]
  should become [context] which is only the "context".

* (2005-09-01) add a new directory [utils] where many loadable
  libraries will be in. move some built-ins and ctors to there.
