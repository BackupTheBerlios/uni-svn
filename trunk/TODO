* (2005-05-06) instead of classifying operators as
  prefix, postfix, and infix, operators should be
  considered as "absorbers", and each can "absorbe"
  a certain number of lexicons on either or both side.
  for example, operator [+] will be an absorber of (1,1)
  [!] will be an absorber of (1,0).

* (2005-05-06) scanners should be in cascade structure.
  one scanner can pass stuff to another scanner.
  this would allow things like markup language easier
  to implement.

* (2005-06-17) some arguments should be passed to scanners
  so that scanners can be more flexible. e.g. change the
  comment splitters, and quotation marks.

* (2005-09-09) use smart pointer for BindState, since they
  are now not freed.

* (2005-09-11) use smart pointer for Scanners in
  [libuni-import], since they are now not freed.
