* (2005-04-20) now, scanner scan the whole file all at once,
  before anything can be executed. as a result,
  code that change the behavior of the scanner
  will HAVE NO EFFECT when execute a file. this
  makes "str_ctor" USELESS.

* (2005-04-20) instead of inserting symbols, the
  [scanner] can insert application on [name_get]

* (2005-05-06) instead of classifying operators as
  prefix, postfix, and infix, operators should be
  considered as "absorbers", and each can "absorbe"
  a certain number of lexicons on either or both side.
  for example, operator [+] will be an absorber of (1,1)
  [!] will be an absorber of (1,0).

* (2005-05-06) scanners should be in cascade structure.
  one scanner can pass stuff to another scanner.
  this would allow things like markup language easier
  to implement.
