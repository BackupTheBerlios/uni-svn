* now, scanner scan the whole file all at once,
  before anything can be executed. as a result,
  code that change the behavior of the scanner
  will HAVE NO EFFECT when execute a file. this
  makes "str_ctor" USELESS. (2005-4-20)

* [2005-4-20] instead of inserting symbols, the
  [scanner] can insert application on [name_get]
